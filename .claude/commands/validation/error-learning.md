# Error Learning Check
Check if we're repeating failed approaches.

## Questions to Ask:
1. Did this approach fail before?
2. What was the error message?
3. What alternative approach should we try?
4. Are we adapting based on previous failures?

## Learning Pattern:
- Try approach A
- If fails â†’ Document why
- Try approach B (different method)
- Don't repeat approach A
